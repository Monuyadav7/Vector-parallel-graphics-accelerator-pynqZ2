TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock rasterizer_ee712_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock rasterizer_ee712_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin rasterizer_ee712_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.574 ns between rasterizer_ee712_i/smartconnect_0/inst/switchboards/i_nodes/i_w_node/inst/inst_mi_handler/gen_normal_area.inst_fifo_node_payld/gen_reg_fifo.inst_reg_fifo/gen_single_rank.data_reg[34]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and rasterizer_ee712_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/CLK_CORE_DRP_I/ram_clk_config_reg[27][11]/D (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -filter {NAME =~ *SyncAsync*/oSyncStages_reg[0]/D} -hier]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '10' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

Vector Parallel graphics accelerator is a SoC which is optimised for the task of triangle rasterisation. 
Rasterisation is a task of identifying the location of the pixels which are being occupied by the image and what is the colour each of those pixels are. In our case the image is a triangle.My dissertation explored the use of a vector parallel approach to optimise this task. The vector data in question are the x and y coordinates of the pixels in the screen.
These are 640 and 480 bits long. The vertex coordinates for the triangles are fed into the system by the FPGA switches. These are read by the processor and given as inputs to rasteriser pipelined module. This module performs a set of parallel computation on the array of pixel coordinates and spits out the pixel values. These are copied to a ram module that caches the data for VGA video interface. The throughput is one pixel data every 30 clock cycles for s/w raster (652ns) and one pixel data every 10 clock cycles for h/w raster. clock time is 20ns ie 50Mhz. Need to be validated, calculated theoratically.
